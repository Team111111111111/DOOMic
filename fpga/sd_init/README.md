### The memory initializer

This directory contains the entity for the RAM initialization (the `ram_initializer`), that is meant to initialize the RAM module by writing the data that is present in a specific address range in the SD card to the RAM module.

The VHDL code has been compiled (or whatever the VHDL-specific term might be) but has not been tested as of 12/11/2023.
