# DOOM

This project is about making IC that runs DOOM engine and works with FPGA that emulates "chip-set" and takes control over the memory management and stuff.

## Naming conventions

All filenames should only consist of lowercase ascii characters and underscores. Files containing VHDL code should have the `.vhdl` extension rather than the `.vhd` extension.

## Repository policies

Committing binary files is not allowed. Rather, commit the raw `.drawio` files. These only contain text. Images can be uploaded directly to pages on the wiki.
